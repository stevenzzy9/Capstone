# Capstone

the application aims to automatically adjust the status of a mobile phone based on the user’s location, the time of day, and activity of the user. It has been observed that people want to have more control over when they receive cell phone calls, depending on their current context. For example, they prefer not to take unexpected calls during a meeting with their boss. This project identifies three different environments: at work, at home and on the go. When at work, the phone is set to be in silent or vibration mode for meetings based on the calendar. The application also gives suggestions for restaurants near the office during lunchtime. When at home, the application will list movies playing for the next few hours in cinemas nearby. When on the go, the application will give directions from the phone’s current location to points of interest, the distance to the desired destination, and estimated time of travel.
This application is written as a service running in the background. The user can use his/her cell phone as usual without the need to close the application. The application, on the other end, will automatically adjust the smart phone’s status based on the phone’s context information, such as user’s location, the time of day and user’s Google calendar content.
